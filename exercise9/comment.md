**Study Drills**

Check your work, write down your mistakes, try not to make them on the next exercise.



- Question 1

Why do the \n newlines not work when I use %r?

That's how %r formatting works; it prints it the way you wrote it (or close to it). It's the "raw" format for debugging.


- Question 2

Why do I get an error when I put spaces between the three double-quotes?

You have to type them like """ and not " " ", meaning with no spaces between each one.


- Question 3

Is it bad that my errors are always spelling mistakes?

Most programming errors in the beginning (and even later) are simple spelling mistakes, typos, or getting simple things out of order.
