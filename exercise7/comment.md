- 1

Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.

- 2

Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.

- 3

From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.

When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and try not to make them in this new one.

Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.

- Question 1

Why are you using the variable named 'snow'?

That's actually not a variable: it is just a string with the word snow in it. A variable wouldn't have the single-quotes around it.

- Question 2

Is it normal to write an English comment for every line of code like you say to do in Study Drill 1?

No, you write comments only to explain difficult to understand code or why you did something. Why is usually much more important, and then you try to write the code so that it explains how something is being done on its own. However, sometimes you have to write such nasty code to solve a problem that it does need a comment on every line. In this case it's strictly for you to practice translating code to English.

- Question 3

Can I use single-quotes or double-quotes to make a string or do they do different things?

In Python either way to make a string is acceptable although typically you'll use single-quotes for any short strings like 'a' or 'snow'.


- Question 4

Why do you put ' (single-quotes) around some strings and not others?
Mostly it's because of style, but I'll use a single-quote inside a string that has double-quotes. 
Look at line 10 to see how I'm doing that.


- Question 5

Couldn't you just not use the comma , and turn the last two lines into one single-line print?

Yes, you could very easily, but then it'd be longer than 80 characters, which in Python is bad style.
